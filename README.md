- **Multiple Report Types**:
  - **Vulnerabilities**: View detected vulnerabilities with severity levels
  - **Security Checks**: Review security checks with pass/fail status
  - **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: Examine components used in your applications
  - **Secrets**: Identify detected secrets in your applications
  - **Compliance**: Check compliance status with various standards
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter and sort reports by various criteria
- **Export Capabilities**: Export reports in CSV, Markdown, and JSON formats
- **Detailed Views**: Drill down into specific reports for detailed information
- **Kubernetes Native**: Seamlessly integrates with your Kubernetes cluster

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with trivy-operator installed
- Redis instance for caching (optional but recommended)
- Node.js v22+ (for development)

## Installation

### Using Helm

```bash
# Add the Helm repository (if available)
# helm repo add trivy-glass https://your-helm-repo-url

# Install the chart
helm install trivy-glass ./chart \
  --namespace trivy-system \
  --set settings.cluster=your-cluster-name
```

### Configuration Options

See the [values.yaml](chart/values.yaml) file for configuration options.
